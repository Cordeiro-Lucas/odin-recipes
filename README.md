This is a Project part of The Odin Project Curriculum, more specifically the HTML Foundations Section.

The goal is to apply the foundations learned until this point. Creating the root page, connecting pages with links, embedding images and using basic formatting.

In this project, one must create a simple webpage containing 3 recipes.
